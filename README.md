# Econometric-1
The course “Econometrics 1” is designed to introduce the students to statistical, econometric, and programming tools which are widely used in economics, particularly in finance and microeconomics.

Lectures will proceed from motivating examples and sample models in economics to general principles
of statistical and econometric modeling. Also, a number of computer exercises using the Python
programming languages and its excellent statistical libraries will be distributed in order to give students
an opportunity to practice econometric techniques.
